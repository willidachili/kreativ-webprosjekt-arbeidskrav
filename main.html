          <h3>Superman origins</h3>
          <p>
            Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name
            Kal-El at birth. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small
            spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural
            cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the
            town Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and
            Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various
            superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious
            skin. His foster parents advised him to use his abilities for the
            benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante.
            To protect his privacy, he changes into his superhero costume and
            uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark Kent resides in
            the American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for
            the Daily Planet.

          <h3>Powers and abilities</h3>
          <p>
            Superman has a wide range of superhuman abilities and powers to aid
            in his crimefighting. He has superhuman strength, being able to
            crush coal into diamonds with his bare hands and even shift the
            orbit of planets. His body is highly durable and invulnerable to
            almost anything. Bullets bounce harmlessly off his body, and even a
            nuclear bomb cant stop him. Superman has the ability to fly at great
            speeds, breaking the sound barrier and in some cases even faster
            than light to travel to distant galaxies. He can project and
            percieve X-rays, which allows him to see through objects. His vision
            can also be amplified to project rays of burning heat, hot enough to
            melt steel. Superman is able to hear sounds that are too faint for
            the human ear, and frequencies outside the human hearing range. With
            these powers combined there's only one man capable of competing with
            him...

          <h3>Archnemesis</h3>
          <p>
            Lex Luthor is one of the most dangerously intelligent men on the
            planet. He is a super-villain, a brilliant scientist, a billionaire
            industrialist and Superman's greatest enemy. This combination makes
            him an extremely powerful and formidable opponent; he is ruthless,
            efficient and creative. In addition to his personal vendetta against
            the man who thwarts his every scheme, he despises the alien Man of
            Steel from an ideological standpoint for contradicting his human
            achievements. He has always been a controversial figure in the
            public eye due to LexCorp's corrupt business dealings, but he has
            also maintained political popularity.
